# surfs_up

## Project Overview

This project serves the purpose on providing detailed information on temperatures trends before building and opening the surf shop. Specifically we require the temperature information for the months of June and December in Oahu. This would help on determine the viability for the shop success.

## Challenge requirements

- Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
- Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December
- Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis README.md.

## Resources

- Data file: hawaii.sqlite
- Software: Matplotli 3.2.2, Python 3.9, Visual Studio Code 1.50.0, Anaconda 4.8.5, Jupyter Notebook 6.1.4, Pandas, Numpy, Sqlalchemy.

## Analysis 

1. The mean temperature for June (75째F) is higher than the mean temperature for December (71째F). In terms of precipitation is the opposite. December had a higher precipation volume .22 inches and June had .14 inches

2. The higher temperature for both months are slightly similar (85째F for June) and (83째F for December)

3. The minimum temperatures for both months exhibit the greatest variance. December temperature is much lower than June. Standard deviation on december is 3.74, we would expect a bit more variation in december stats.

Precipitation rates were a main concern for the investors. If we compare June and December weather patterns, everything remains fairly similar. With these results opening the surf and ice cream shop could be a viable bussiness.
